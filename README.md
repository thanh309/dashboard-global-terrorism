# Global Terrorism Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an interactive web-based dashboard designed to visualize global terrorism data. The dashboard is developed using the Dash framework and Plotly library in Python, offering users an intuitive and engaging way to explore and analyze terrorism trends across the globe.

## Features

- **Introduction Page:** Provides an overview of the project, including instructions on how to navigate through the dashboard.
- **Home Page:** Displays key indices such as total casualties, total number of attacks, and offers general visualizations.
- **Geography Dashboard:** Contains interactive maps and charts to explore terrorist incidents based on geographic locations.
- **Time Dashboard:** Includes time series plots and other visualizations to analyze temporal patterns and trends in terrorism data.

## Visual Design

The dashboard features a black background with subtle drops of blood, creating a visually striking environment that aligns with the seriousness of the data. The background is slightly dimmed to ensure that the plots and visualizations are clear and prominent. A consistent dark red color theme is used throughout the dashboard, enhancing the thematic coherence and visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **Dash:** A Python framework for building web applications.
- **Plotly:** A graphing library that enables the creation of interactive, publication-quality graphs.
